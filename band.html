  <h2>CD Releases + Reviews</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>The Prodigal</dt>
    <dd>I really enjoyed the Prodigal. It has a mix of upbeat songs and slow but meaningful songs. I also really liked the Bibilicl themes that were represented throughout. My favorite song was "Things That Matter" and "Take Me Home".</dd>

    <dt>Mt. Zion</dt>
    <dd>Mt. Zion was exactly like The Prodigal in the sense that I absolutely loved it. I loved the songs "Slow Down Please" and "The Meaning Of Life"</dd>

    <dt>JESUS IS COMING BACK SOON</dt>
    <dd>This was a single release so it was only one song. However, this one song was absolutely amazing. I loved how Josiah Queen collabed with Forrest Frank. The song was so good.</dd>
